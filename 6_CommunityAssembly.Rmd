## Niche theory

The niche is a multidimensional description of a species resource needs, habitat requirements and environmental tolerances<sup>1</sup> 
- i.e. a particular set of abiotic (light, water, nutrient, shelter, etc) and biotic conditions (predators, prey, pathogens, mutualists (e.g. mycorrhizae, pollinators), competitors, etc)
- often explored by looking at where species occur in the environment, or by looking at their traits, assuming these reflect resource use strategies

## Niche theory

Niche theory predicts local deterministic processes like habitat filtering, competition, facilitation, etc.
- These processes influence the co-occurrence/coexistence, trait/functional similarity and relatedness of species
- Thus influencing various forms of diversity (species, functional, phylogenetic)

Where functional similarity reflects phylogeny:

- **Sympatric speciation** (in situ speciation) = phylogenetic and functional clustering

- **Allopatric speciation** (speciation via dispersal, isolation and drift) = phylogenetic and functional evenness/overdispersion

_i.e. the mode of speciation can create the same pattern as competition or habitat filtering..._

## Community assembly processes

.pull-left[

#### Vary with spatial scale
- competition or facilitation operates between neighbouring individuals
- environmental filtering operates at a range of scales (climate > soils > microsite, etc)
- biogeographic processes (speciation, extinction, vicariance, dispersal) operate across large extents

#### Vary with temporal scale
- pollination, seed dispersal, herbivory, predation, etc can be near-instantaneous
- speciation or trait evolution occur over long periods of time (typically >100s of generations)

## Assembly of species pools across scales

Community assembly can be thought of as the successive filtering of species pools descending in spatial (and temporal) scale from global to local

We often split it into **regional** versus **local** processes

## Dominant processes vary with the relative scale of your species pools

Community assembly can be thought of as the successive filtering of species pools descending in spatial (and temporal) scale from global to local.

The outcomes of your analyses can depend in the scale at which your communities and regional species pools are defined, because different processes are more or less important at different scales.

### An example of inferring community assembly from the Cape...

Three scales (pools):
- Global = Cape Floristic Region (CFR)
- Regional = Cape Peninsula (Pen)
- Local = plots within Silvermine (Silv)

.footnote[###### Slingsby 2011, PhD]

]

.pull-right[

```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/centresofendemism.png")
```

The set of species on the Peninsula and in Silvermine are more dissimilar than expected relative to the CFR - _**suggests allopatric speciation**_

Species at Silvermine more dissimilar than expected relative to the Peninsula - _**suggests competition**_

Species within plots are more dissimilar than expected relative to all plots - _**suggests competition**_

## Take-home

*Patterns of diversity are determined by assembly processes that operate from local to regional scales*

*While the distinction between local and regional processes is somewhat arbitrary (or even artificial), local scale processes are typically ecological, operating over the near term, while regional processes are typically evolutionary, operating over longer periods of time*

*One method for investigating these processes by exploring functional and phylogenetic diversity at different scales (species pools), often in combination with null models*

The Cape phytochoria make good _Regional species pools_, but the regional pools used can be defined differently depending on the purposes of the study and if it can be justified, e.g. the Cape Peninsula is a relatively isolated biogeographic unit

CFR effectively = _Global species pool_, because of such high endemism
