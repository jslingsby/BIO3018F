## The components of diversity

Alpha $(\alpha)$ = mean species diversity/richness within local-scale sites, habitats or communities (often termed "point diversity")

Beta $(\beta)$ = diversity/richness differences between sites or habitats (attributable to species "turnover" or "nestedness")

Gamma $(\gamma)$ = total landscape species diversity/richness

*S* = a simple count of species

*H'* = Species diversity quantified using the Shannon index $(H' = -\sum_{i=1}^{n}(p_i*ln(p_i))$ where $p_i$ is the proportion of individuals belonging to the *i*th species. 

*H'* takes into account both species richness and evenness in their relative abundance.

A community is considered more diverse if the relative abundance of species is more evenly distributed. The logic being that if you remove one individual, more even communities are less likely to lose species.

## Quantifying $\alpha$-diversity...

Many studies will refer to species counts as "species richness", but this is often in error...

Species counts are sensitive to the number of individuals sampled. 

More individuals means greater potential to encounter more species.

## Quantifying $\alpha$-diversity...

Dependence of species counts on number of individuals sampled is problematic when the number of individuals varies between samples (e.g. vegetation plots, netting events, etc).

```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fire_age.png")
```

While raw species counts can still be useful for many purposes, it is also useful to have a metric that is independent of abundance and sampling effort.

Since the samples are of a set unit area (50m<sup>2</sup>), the species counts in this figure can also be termed ***species density***.

## Quantifying $\alpha$-diversity...

###*Species richness* 
...is usually reserved to mean an estimate of the richness of species while taking abundance and sampling effort into account (see Gotelli and Colwell 2001 for review).

...is often estimated using individual or sample-based ***rarefaction***. 

This is done by resampling a set number (*n*) of individuals or samples from the full dataset to determine the expected number of species for any given *n*. For each *n* the resampling is repeated multiple times and the expected species number determined as an average.

## The decomposition of diversity...

The components of biodiversity are interrelated. How this is expressed depends on your interpretation of $\beta$-diversity, which varies the application at hand.


As "turnover" it is multiplicative (*sensu* Whittaker 1972):

$$\beta = \gamma/\alpha$$

As "average amount of diversity not found in a single, randomly-chosen sample" it is additive<sup>1</sup> (*sensu* MacArthur et al. 1966, Lande 1996):

$$\beta = \gamma - \alpha$$

.footnote[<sup>1</sup>often termed "additive partitioning of diversity". For reviews see Veech et al. 2002 and Anderson et al. 2011.]
