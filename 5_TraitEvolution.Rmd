## There are often trade-offs among traits

Leaf dry mass per unit area (LMA) predicts 
- Nitrogen content 
- photosynthetic capacity
- relative growth rate

But
- Trades off against leaf longevity

.pull-left[
## There are often trade-offs among traits

LMA correlates with environment (temp and rainfall)
- Higher LMA in hot, dry places

<br>

This also represents a trade-off in that specific traits can limit species to specific resource/habitat requirements (water, light, nutrients).

## Trade-offs constrain trait combinations

.pull-left[
Trade-offs dictate that some traits and trait combinations (and thus life-history strategies) are impossible...

<br>

If each trait is a dimension, trade-offs dictate that the "volume" of the trait space is constrained (cannot be filled).

## Trade-offs constrain trait combinations

.pull-left[
Traits and trade-offs often vary among taxonomic lineages, revealing a signal of their evolutionary history (phylogeny).

```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '75%'}

## Trait conservatism has a profound influence on ecology!

.pull-left[
Especially if there is dispersal limitation, as is usually the case for islands... e.g. Darwin's finches

The finches have diversified to fill many niches on the Galapagos     islands that are usually filled by other bird lineages elsewhere.

While there has been convergence in some traits (e.g. beak morphology), they all evolved from the same common ancestor and other traits that affect their ecology may be constrained (e.g. climatic tolerance, metabolism, etc).

## Trait conservatism has a profound influence on ecology!

.pull-left[
The Cape Flora is much like an island flora, with many species made up from a few lineages (30 clades account for >50% of the ~9000 species).

Large clades like the Proteaceae (~300 spp), Restionaceae (~300 spp) and *Erica* (~700 species) are also ecologically dominant, and have a big influence on ecological processes like fire, hydrology, nutrient cycling, etc.

## Trait conservatism has a profound influence on ecology!

.pull-left[
Savannas inhabit different climatic niches on different continents...

```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/lehman2014.jpeg")
```

.footnote[Lehman et al. 2014 *Science*]

]

.pull-right[

```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/moncrieff2014.png")
```

This is likely because of the traits of the dominant lineages and their affects on ecosystem feedbacks, e.g. *Vachellia* and *Senegalia* in Africa versus *Eucalyptus* and *Corymbia* in Australia.

## Trait conservatism has a profound influence on ecology!

In fact, the same may apply to most major biomes in the world...

.footnote[Moncrieff et al. 2015 *GEB*]

## Trait conservatism influence on biogeography!

.pull-left[

```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/crisp2009_1.png")
```

]

.pull-right[

```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/crisp2009_2.png")
```

Speciation is more likely to occur via dispersal to the same biome on a different continent than a shift to a neighbouring, but different biome!

## Take-home

*The evolutionary history of species leaves a strong imprint on current ecology, especially through trait and nice conservatism.*

*

*Functional and phylogenetic diversity allow us to explore more intricate questions around the ecology, evolution and function of assemblages.*

*Null models can be useful for exploring the factors that determine the assembly of communities.*
