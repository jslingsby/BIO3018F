## The components of diversity

Alpha $(\alpha)$ = mean species diversity/richness within local-scale sites, habitats or communities (often termed "point diversity")

Beta $(\beta)$ = diversity/richness differences between sites or habitats (attributable to species "turnover" or "nestedness")

Gamma $(\gamma)$ = total landscape species diversity/richness

## Measuring $\beta$ diversity

There are two major approaches:

* *"Classical" diversity metrics*, calculated directly from measures of regional $(\gamma)$ and local $(\alpha)$ diversity through additive or multiplicative decomposition

* *Multivariate measures* that calculate distances (or dissimilarities) that represent the compositional resemblance between pairs of samples

.footnote[The two are related, and can even be the same thing in certain scenarios, but I'm not going to go there in this course...]

## The decomposition of "classical" diversity metrics...

Consider this in the context of the species-area relationship. 

If $\gamma$ is constant (32) across sites, then
- Site 1 = higher $\alpha$, lower $\beta$
- Site 2 = intermediate $\alpha$ and $\beta$
- Site 3 = lower $\alpha$, higher $\beta$

## Comparing floras...

We often compare the diversity of different regions using species-area curves (usually on log-log axes so the curves are linear) - e.g. Cowling et al. 2015

## The decomposition of "classical" diversity metrics...

The components of biodiversity are interrelated and, depending on your preference or application, can be expressed

Multiplicatively (*sensu* Whittaker 1972):

$$\beta = \gamma/\alpha$$

Additively (*sensu* MacArthur et al. 1966, Lande 1996):

$$\beta = \gamma - \alpha$$
.footnote[<sup>1</sup>For reviews see Veech et al. 2002 and Anderson et al. 2011.]

## Multiplicative "classical" diversity

$\beta = \gamma/\alpha$ (*sensu* Whittaker 1972)

...expresses $\beta$ diversity as the ratio of landscape $(\gamma)$ to local $(\alpha)$ diversity (usually the mean of multiple local samples, i.e. $\bar{\alpha}$).

If most local $(\alpha)$ samples capture most of the landscape $(\gamma)$ diversity, then $\beta$ diversity (i.e. differences between sites or habitats) must be low, and vv.

Disadvantages: 
* the ratio is unitless
* usually need to know $(\gamma)$

## Additive "classical" diversity

$\beta = \gamma - \alpha$ (*sensu* MacArthur et al. 1966, Lande 1996)

...expresses $\beta$ diversity as the difference between landscape $(\gamma)$ and local $(\alpha)$ diversity (again, usually the mean of multiple local samples, i.e. $\bar{\alpha}$).

If local $(\alpha)$ samples capture most of the landscape $(\gamma)$ diversity, then $\beta$ diversity (i.e. differences between sites or habitats) must be low, and vv.

Advantage:
* the difference is expressed as species (i.e. the average number of species missing from each local site)

Disadvantage: still usually need to know $(\gamma)$

## Multivariate measures...

There are a large number of metrics that calculate the dissimilarity of pairs of samples based on the number of species that are shared between them or unique to each.

The metrics typically differ in whether they:

* are based on species presence/absence only, or also include abundance information

* include/exclude joint absence information

* account for differences in the $\alpha$ diversity of samples

Values range from 0 (identical communities) to 1 (complete turnover).

## *Turnover* vs *Variation*

The application of $\beta$ diversity can be largely split into: 
* directional analyses, that explore *turnover* along spatial, temporal or environmental gradients, and 

* non-directional analyses, that explore *variation* within or among groups.

## "Turnover" applications

Typically explores change in community composition of one or more groups (e.g. taxa) along one or more gradients (e.g. distance, time, elevation, rainfall).

$\Delta$y = change in community composition

$\Delta$x = change in gradient

$\delta y/\delta x$ = rate of turnover along a gradient

## "Variation" applications

Typically explores the amount of variation in community composition among sample units across one or more groups (e.g. taxa), sometimes trying to partition the drivers of variation among factors (e.g. experimental treatments), spatial scales or environmental variables.

$\Delta$y = change in community composition

$\hat{\sigma}$<sup>2</sup> = variation in community  structure among sample units  

$\bar{d}$<sub>cen</sub> = average distance-to-centroid of all sample units
