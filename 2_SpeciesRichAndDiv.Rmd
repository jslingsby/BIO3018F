## $\alpha$-diversity

The species diversity/richness within local-scale sites, habitats or communities (often termed "point diversity") is called **alpha $(\alpha)$ diversity**.

A community is considered more diverse if the relative abundances are more evenly distributed 
- because removing one individual is less likely to remove a species.

**Shannon's index** (*H'*) quantifies species diversity taking into account both species' richness and evenness in their relative abundance

$H' = -\sum_{i=1}^{n}(p_i*ln(p_i))$ 

where $p_i$ is the proportion of individuals belonging to the *i*th species.

<br>

You can also quantify evenness independently of richness, e.g. **Pielou's evenness** (*J*) in the relative abundance (independent of *S*) can be calculated directly as $J = H'/log(S)$

## Quantifying $\alpha$-diversity...

Many studies will refer to species counts as "species richness", but this is often in error...

Species counts are sensitive to the number of individuals sampled. 

More individuals means greater potential to encounter more species.

## Quantifying $\alpha$-diversity...

Dependence of species counts on number of individuals sampled is problematic when the number of individuals varies between samples (e.g. vegetation plots, netting events, etc).

```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fire_age.png")
```

While raw species counts can still be useful for many purposes, it is also useful to have a metric that is independent of abundance and sampling effort.

## Species-Area relationship

.pull-left[

We often compare the diversity of large areas using the species-area relationship (SAR).

```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sad.png")
```

]

.pull-right[

We estimate the SAR by sampling nested plots of increasing size.

```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '40%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/nested_plots.png")
```

When comparing sites, one solution is to sample enough area to reach the asymptote of the SAR. 

This isn't often logistically (or logically) feasible, so we usually fit curves to estimate the diversity of the larger area by extrapolation.

## Species-Area relationship

.pull-left[

The density of individuals can affect the shape of the species-area relationship (SAR) at fine scales, because of the relationship between species counts and the number of individuals sampled.

```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sad.png")
```


]

.pull-right[

- Site 1 = many, small individuals
- Site 2 = intermediate
- Site 3 = fewer, large individuals

<br>

Note that many other factors can affect the SAR:
- patchiness/heterogeneity
- dispersal (limitation)
- immigration/extinction
- disturbance
- productivity (e.g. sparse desert vegetation has fewer individuals per unit area)

## Quantifying $\alpha$-diversity...

###*Species richness* 
...is usually reserved to mean an estimate of the number of species while taking abundance and sampling effort into account (see Gotelli and Colwell 2001 for review).

...is often estimated using individual or sample-based ***rarefaction***<sup>1</sup>. 

Rarefaction involves resampling a set number (*n*) of individuals or samples from the data to determine the expected number of species for any given *n*. Resampling is repeated multiple times for each *n* and the results averaged.

Rarefying by samples doesn't really get around the issue of different numbers of individuals though...

## Take home
Alpha diversity is the diversity at a point location (e.g. a vegetation plot).

Measures of species diversity can consider both the counts of species and evenness in their relative abundance.

Measures of species diversity are affected by factors like the area and number of individuals sampled. Other factors can be important too, like the length of time sampled for (e.g. bird netting, fishing, etc).

You need to choose your measure of diversity carefully, and potentially correct for these sampling effects (e.g. by using rarefaction, sampling a larger area, estimating the species-area relationship), depending on your question and the taxonomic groups you're working on.
