We are on a newly discovered island. We need to do a **quantitative** survey of the ecosystems on the island so as to describe their biodiversity and infer the key ecological processes that drive them.

What are you going to measure?

Sample _Environmental conditions:_

- Estimate % projected cover (think the area you would see from above) bare soil

- Take a densiometer reading at ground level

- Take a **soil sample** from the 4 corners to measure volumetric soil water content

- Do a **dung count**? Or just note presence/absence?

- Note presence/absence of burnt dead skeletons or charcoal

- Note prevalence of serotiny
  
- Take a few notes (and photos) on any features you think may be interesting

**Shannon's index** (*H'*) quantifies species diversity taking into account both species' richness and _**evenness**_ in their relative abundance

$H' = -\sum_{i=1}^{n}(p_i*ln(p_i))$ 

where $p_i$ is the proportion of individuals belonging to the *i*th species.

<br>

You can also quantify evenness independently of richness, e.g. 

- **Pielou's evenness** (*J*) in the relative abundance (independent of *S*) can be calculated directly as $J = H'/log(S)$

## Quantifying $\alpha$-diversity...

Many studies will refer to species counts as "species richness", but this is often in error...

Species counts are sensitive to the number of individuals sampled. 

More individuals means greater potential to encounter more species.

## Quantifying $\alpha$-diversity...

Dependence of species counts on number of individuals sampled is problematic when the number of individuals varies between samples (e.g. vegetation plots of different area or with different size individuals, netting events, etc).

```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fire_age.png")

While raw species counts can still be useful for many purposes, it is also useful to have a metric that is independent of abundance and sampling effort.

## Species-Area relationship

We often compare the diversity of large areas using the species-area relationship (SAR).

<br>

We estimate the SAR by sampling nested areas of increasing size.

```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '40%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/nested_plots.png")
```

When comparing sites, one solution is to sample enough area to reach the asymptote of the SAR. 

This isn't often logistically (or logically) feasible, so we usually fit curves to estimate the diversity of the larger area by extrapolation.

## Species-Area relationship

The density of individuals can affect the shape of the species-area relationship (SAR) at fine scales, because of the relationship between species counts and the number of individuals sampled.

```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sad.png")

]

.pull-right[

Many factors can affect the SAR:
- size of individuals
- patchiness/heterogeneity
- dispersal (limitation)
- immigration/extinction
- disturbance
- productivity (e.g. sparse desert vegetation has fewer individuals per unit area)

All sites have same total # of species, but may vary in:
- Site 1 = many, small individuals
- Site 2 = intermediate
- Site 3 = fewer, large individuals

Or:
- Site 1 = homogenous/uniform spread of species
- Site 2 = intermediate
- Site 3 = heterogenous/patchy spread of species

Rarefaction involves resampling a set number (*n*) of individuals or samples from the data to determine the expected number of species for any given *n*. Resampling is repeated multiple times for each *n* and the results averaged.
