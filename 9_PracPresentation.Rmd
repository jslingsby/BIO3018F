## The evolution of Biodiversity-Ecosystem Function research

There's been a shift towards acknowledging the 3-way interplay between environmental drivers, the properties of biotic communities and ecosystem function.

These feedbacks are particularly likely where there are linkages and trade-offs in the traits that determine species _response_ to the selective environment versus the traits that determine their _effect_ on the environment _sensu_ [Diaz and Cabido 2001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534701022832) (especially Box 2).

]

We'll look at ~4 sites with different vegetation and traits

---

####Aim:
To use species' traits to explore how species both respond to and modify resources and ecological processes in their environment and thus infer community assembly processes and biotic effects on ecosystem function.

Over and above the abiotic template, the main ecological processes of interest here are:
- interspecific interactions (e.g. competition)
- disturbance by fire
- disturbance by herbivory

---

####Hypothesis:

Differences in the relative dominance of ecological processes across ecosystems in De Hoop Nature Reserve should be reflected in both the emergent properties of each ecosystem as a whole and in the structure, composition and function of plant biodiversity within each such that the dominant plant traits create feedbacks to maintain each ecological process.

####Questions:

- What are the dominant ecological processes determining community assembly and ecosystem function in each ecosystem sampled? How is this reflected in species' "response" and "effect" traits?

- Are there any correlations between "response" and "effect" traits that could create selective trade-offs within species, or potentially generate ecosystem-level feedbacks?

- To what degree is variation in traits determined by evolutionary history (i.e. the phylogenetic relationships among species)?

- Is there any evidence that the dominant ecological processes across the reserve may be being altered and what are the likely consequences?

## At each point location we'll

Sample _Environmental conditions:_

- Estimate % projected cover (think the area you would see from above) bare soil

- Take a densiometer reading at ground level (a measure of canopy cover / shade / competition for light)

- Take a **soil sample** for soil moisture (weigh, dry and re-weigh)

- Do a **dung count** transect

- Look for evidence of historical fires (burn scars, dead burnt skeletons, charcoal)
  
- Take a few notes (and photos) on any features you think may be interesting

---

## At each point location we'll

Sample _Traits:_

- Decide on which are the dominant species (by % projected cover) to make up 80% of the vegetation cover.

- Make sure your smartphone is fully charged and set to record GPS location with your photographs!

- Take diagnostic photos for the species (habit (whole plant), leaf, base, flowers and/or fruits) and estimate their % cover

- For six individuals of each of the target species, 
  - measure the height and canopy diameter (in 2 perpendicular axes)
  - collect shoot for measuring leaf traits back at the Potberg centre (length, width, area and dry mass).
  - collect a 70cm long shoot/branch

- Take a pic of your site label between sites so you know what photos (and species) are from where.

## Data analysis!!!

First, we need to download the data, which we can do directly from Google Drive

```{r}
# Get necessary packages
library(tidyverse)
library(googlesheets4)
library(googledrive)
library(readxl)
library(GGally)
library(taxize)
library(reactable)

# Tell Google drive and Google sheets the file is open to view
drive_deauth()
gs4_deauth()

# Download file to a local directory (SET YOUR OWN!!!)
sheet <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VYMvHk7b_GcVFxCLYt4GUyUIMfrgWasQT7uy6aE0_ms/edit#gid=1570965423"
drive_download(sheet, path = "prac/flammability/flammabilitytraits2024.xlsx", overwrite = TRUE)
```

Set `path = ` to wherever you want to save the data on your laptop...

---

## Read in data

```{r}
traits <- read_xlsx("prac/flammability/flammabilitytraits2024.xlsx","TraitData")
fire <- read_xlsx("prac/flammability/flammabilitytraits2024.xlsx","Flammability")
taxonomy <- read_xlsx("prac/flammability/flammabilitytraits2024.xlsx","AcceptedSpecies")
site <- read_xlsx("prac/flammability/flammabilitytraits2024.xlsx","SiteData")
```

Set the file path to wherever you saved the data on your laptop...

## Summarise the site data
