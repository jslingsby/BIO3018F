## What is a feedback?

> _"the modification or control of a process or system by its results or effects"_ - Oxford Dictionary

<br>

**Feedbacks (in ecology) can be positive or negative:**

- **Positive (amplifying) feedback:** 
  - "a feedback process where a stimulus (e.g., disturbance) causes a reaction _**in the same direction**_ and thus it amplifies the stimulus. Thus, it moves the system away from equilibrium; it generates instability, and when strong enough, causes state shifts. It may require an external force to initiate it."

- **Negative (stabilizing) feedback:** 
  - "a feedback process where a stimulus (e.g., disturbance) causes a reaction _**in the opposite direction**_ so that the state of the system is maintained. Negative feedbacks promote stability (e.g., homeostasis) and ensure the maintenance of a steady, stable state."

.footnote[Definitions from Pausas and Bond 2022. _Trends in Ecology and Evolution_]

## What are feedbacks in ecology?

Organisms can modify their environment, and these modifications can feed back to the organism and generate emergent properties at different scales, with ecological and evolutionary consequences...

```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '55%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pausas_bond_2022.jpg")
```

.footnote[Definitions from Pausas and Bond 2022. _Trends in Ecology and Evolution_]

## Emergence... 

Emergent properties are properties and behaviors of a system as a whole that its parts do not have on their own - they emerge thanks to the interactions among parts.

<br>

For example, in biology, each level of organization has properties which emerge at that level. 
- organisms are not just a group of organs, 
- ecosystems are not just a group of species

They need to be bound together by specific interactions to emerge as such. Thus, diversity and stability of an ecosystem are emergent properties as are the life and behavior of an organism.

## Implications of feedbacks?

Thresholds from where feedbacks can be disrupted can generate abrupt (nonlinear) changes.
- implications for local scale and global change driven by climate change, invasive species, human activities, etc.

<br>

Feedbacks link across scales and a change at one scale may have big implications for other scales
- e.g. What is the effect of global tree planting? Reduced atmospheric CO2, but also lower albedo (higher temperature absorption) and increased evapotranspiration?
 
<br>

Simple cause–effect thinking may not be adequate.
- e.g. Ideas like competition and habitat filtering applied in niche theory may not account for potential feedbacks and state shifts. How can we incorporate this?

## My research focuses on four questions...

```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '58%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/chapin2.png")
```

1. What determines the composition and diversity of communities and ecosystems at various scales?

2. What is the role of biodiversity in ecosystem function (and derived societal benefits)?

3. How is biodiversity changing and what are the impacts on ecosystem services?

4. How can we mitigate or adapt to changing biodiversity and ecosystem services?
