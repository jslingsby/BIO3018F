## The purpose

This is an opportunity for you to develop your own research project, from conceptualisation to data collection, analysis and interpretation.

The exercise is aimed at helping you learn to develop hypotheses, formulate questions, design field sampling and analysis methods (and test them with a power analysis), collect data, analyse data, interpret and write up your results.

---

# Guidance

We will give you most of the tools and guide you through the process.

Lectures:
- Developing hypotheses and questions (Claire)
- Scientific writing (Claire)
- Power analysis (Jasper)

## The De Hoop landscape includes a wide range of environmental conditions and vegetation communities

```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.height = '60%', warning=F, messages=F}

library(terra, quiet = T)
library(sf, quiet = T)
library(tidyverse, quiet = T)

ndvi <- rast("prac/MODIS/20220130_MODIS_v1g_POT_MOD13Q1_006_NDVI.tif")

# Get veg map and fire and plot
veg <- st_read("/Users/jasper/Documents/Datasets/SANBI/RLE_2021_Remnants/FynRemnantsClean.gpkg", quiet = T)
ndvi_g <- project(ndvi, st_crs(veg)$Wkt)
veg <- st_crop(veg, ndvi_g, quiet = T)
#fire <- st_read("/Users/jasper/Documents/Datasets/Fire/All_Fires_20_21_gw/CNCFires2021Clean.gpkg", quiet = T)
#fire <- st_crop(fire, ndvi_g, quiet = T)
mapview::mapview(veg, zcol = "name", quiet = T) #+
#mapview::mapview(fire, zcol = "year", quiet = T)

## With variation in species and their traits

.pull-left[ 
```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '95%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/eastern_ruens_shale_renosterveld.jpg")
```
]

.pull-right[ 
```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '95%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/potberg_sandstone_fynbos.jpg")
```
]

Allowing plenty of opportunities to ask questions and test hypotheses that require sampling across different environments.

# Deliverable

A brief research report in the format of a paper in the journal [_Biology Letters_](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/rsbl/for-authors).

- 2,500 words maximum, including references.
- Standard journal paper format: 
  - Title 
  - Abstract 
  - Introduction 
  - Methods 
  - Results 
  - Discussion 
  - References
  
- Consider relevant references from the lectures...
- Clearly state your research question(s) and hypothesis(es).
- Provide your power analysis and justification for your sampling design. Describe it in your methods and present it in your results. (Note that few papers present a power analysis even if they do them, but we are asking you to do and present one as it is a good practice to follow and can tell you whether your project is doomed from the start...)
- Feel free to highlight the shortcomings of our study and what you would do to improve it.
