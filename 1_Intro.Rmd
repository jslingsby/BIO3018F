## We depend on biodiversity...

There is growing focus on the importance of biodiversity for our survival

Large global initiatives like the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) focus on strengthening the science-policy interface for biodiversity and ecosystem services for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, long-term human well-being and sustainable development

Attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) depends on the attainment of the goals relating to natural resource management, namely:

- SDG 13 Climate Action
- SDG 14 Life Below Water
- SDG 15 Life On Land

## My research focuses on four questions...

```{r echo = F, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '58%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/chapin.png")
```

1. What determines the composition and diversity of communities and ecosystems at various scales?

2. What is the role of biodiversity in ecosystem function (and derived societal benefits)?

3. How is biodiversity changing and what are the impacts on ecosystem services?

4. How can we mitigate or adapt to changing biodiversity and ecosystem services?

### Understand the role of biodiversity

Here we see relationships between biodiversity metrics and urban ecosystem services (UES) that have been tested empirically (from Schwartz et al. 2017).

## Problem!

> *"The use of different measures or analytical approaches on a single set of data can naturally result in quite different outcomes and interpretations."* - Anderson et al. 2011

i.e., there is no one perfect measure of biodiversity.

<br>

## Take home

We need to be able to measure biodiversity to develop questions, test hypotheses, map priorities, etc

But, _**measures of biodiversity are hypotheses themselves**_! Most biodiversity-related hypotheses should be prefaced *"Assuming our measure of biodiversity is a reasonable approximation of reality, then..."*

It's crucial that we master the methods for measuring and analyzing biodiversity data, and explore the assumptions and implications of the measures we use for the questions and goals at hand...
