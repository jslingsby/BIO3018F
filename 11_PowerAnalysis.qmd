## Power Analysis {background-color="#33431e"}

<br>

No one ever does them... 

<br>

...but they could save so much pain and suffering if they did!!!

## Power Analysis {background-color="#33431e"}

<br>

*Statistical power* is the probability of a hypothesis test finding an effect if there is an effect to be found.

<br>

*Power analysis* is a calculation typically used to estimate the smallest sample size needed for an experiment, given a required significance level, statistical power, and effect size. 

- It is *normally conducted before the data collection*.

## Why do power analysis? {background-color="#33431e"}

<br>

Not knowing the statistical power of your analysis can result in

- missed findings (through Type II Error), or 
- false findings (through Type I Error).

## Why do power analysis? {background-color="#33431e"}

<br>

Type II Error:

- occurs when the researcher erroneously concludes that there is *not* a difference between treatments, when in reality there is...
- this is a common outcome of low statistical power

## Why do power analysis? {background-color="#33431e"}

<br>

Type I Error:

- occurs when the researcher erroneously concludes that there *is* a difference between treatments, when in reality there is not...
- less likely when there is poor statistical power, but can happen if there with low sample sizes of highly variable subjects, or if there is bias in sampling...

## Statistical Power {background-color="#33431e"}

<br>

Is determined by the combination of the:

- $\alpha$ ("significance") level required (e.g. P < 0.05) 
- difference between group means
- variability among subjects
- sample size (the factor we usually have most control over)

## $\alpha$ ("significance") level {.smaller background-color="#33431e"}

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

ddat <- data.frame(x = rnorm(5000, 0, 1), Probability = rep("Normal Curve", 5000))

ggplot(ddat, aes(x, fill = Probability, colour = Probability)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.1, bw = 1) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank()) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 1.96, y = 0, xend = 1.96, yend = 0.3), col = "gray25", size = 0.5, alpha = .2, linetype = 3) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = -1.96, y = 0, xend = -1.96, yend = 0.3), col = "gray25", size = 0.5, alpha = .2, linetype = 3) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = -1.96, y = 0.1, xend = 1.96, yend = 0.1), col = "gray25", size = 0.5, alpha = .2, linetype = 5) +
  annotate("text", x = 0, y = 0.125, label = "95% of samples") +
  annotate("text", x = 3, y = 0.125, label = "Upper 2.5%") +
  annotate("text", x = -3, y = 0.125, label = "Lower 2.5%") +
  ylab("Density") +
  xlim(-5,5)
```

We usually use an $\alpha$ of 0.05 to indicate significant difference. 

- i.e. the probability of the observation not being different to the null is less than 5% (i.e. p < 0.05), or the result should only be observed once or less for every 20 samples. 

This is a subjective cut-off, but is generally accepted in the literature...
